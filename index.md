<p>
I am Christina Gao (高暘), a theoretical particle physicist at the <a href="https://illinois.edu">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a> and <a href="https://www.fnal.gov">Fermilab</a>. I am specialized in particle phenomenology. Currently I am working on designing tabletop experiments with quantum technology to search for dark matter and many other new forces and particles. I am also interested in machine learning's application in particle physics. I completed my Master from the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a> in 2012 and Ph.D. from the <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu">University of California Davis</a> in 2018, followed by a postdoctoral position at Fermilab since then.
