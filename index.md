<p>
I am Christina Gao (高暘), an assistant professor at <a href="https://phy.sustech.edu.cn/about.html?lang=en-us">the Department of Physics of the Southern University of Science and Technology</a>, China. I am specialized in particle phenomenology. Currently, I am working on designing tabletop experiments with quantum technology to search for dark matter, hidden particles, new forces, and gravitational waves. I am also interested in machine learning's application in particle physics. I completed my Master from the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a> in 2012 and Ph.D. from the <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu">University of California Davis</a> in 2018, followed by postdoctoral positions at <a href="https://www.fnal.gov">Fermilab</a> and <a href="https://illinois.edu">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a> from 2019 to 2024.
