<p>
I am Christina Gao (高暘), a theoretical particle physicist at the <a href="https://illinois.edu">University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</a> and <a href="https://www.fnal.gov">Fermilab</a>. I am specialized in designing tabletop experiments with quantum technology to search for dark matter and using machine learning to search for physics beyond the Standard Model. I completed my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu">University of California Davis</a> in 2018, followed by a postdoctoral position at Fermilab since then.
