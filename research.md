    description: If the dark matter is made up from light bosons, its occupation number must be extremely large to yield the observed dark matter abundance. Thus bosonic dark matter, produced in the early universe, can behave as a classical field. It can be described by a matter wave with a macroscopic de Broglie wavelength and a frequency set by the mass of the bosons. If these bosons have very slight interactions with ordinary matter such as light, spins of nucleons and electrons, we may have a chance discovering them directly in the laboratory! Currently I am interested in designing tabletop experiments to look for axions - spin-0 particles that are good candidate for dark matter.

    description: Neutron stars and white dwarves are stellar remnants - dead stars which consist of large numbers of protons, neutrons and electrons. A typical neutron star is as heavy as our Sun, but its density can be as large as 100 trillion times of that of Sun! White dwarf is slightly less extreme with its density a million times more compared to the Sun. If a new force can be sourced by the neutron number, then neutron stars must create a large force field, just as electric field can be produced by electric charge. The fluctuations of the force field are the corresponding particles that may escape the star, taking the star's energy away with them. This introduces a
